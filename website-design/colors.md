# Website Color Guideline
Colors must be picked by the following parameters (dependent on the user base):
## Country
- Always keep an eye out for the history and culture of the demographic. In countries such as China the color **Red** is often a nudge of luck and happiness, nevertheless in the Middle East it could be associated with danger (leading to stress). To further help with this, you can think of what colors are associated with. Red in china is associated to the new year, a new couple (often gifts are given in red envelopes and brides wear red) whilst in other countries its *can* be a symbol of communism (Russia), and sexual altercations. 

In multi-cultured countries its better to use safe colors such as blue, an example of this might be the color black (Example would be of the Japanese Scooter company that failed to sell black scooters in India).

## Gender
Like it or not, gender does play a significant role. Colors such as black, blue which are considered to be masculine colors aren't favored by women who prefer a more feminine color such as pink; thus picking the right color can also maximize your desired consumer base, advertise a period pain relief tool with strong bold masculine colors and men might get interested in what you have to offer while women would have the opposite thought. 

## Ideas and Beliefs
Humans are species that can alter the beliefs in an instant, so when picking your colors always look out for current events that might alter peoples physiological thoughts. Imagine an people of an Islamic country ever so getting further away from Islam, in such a case its better to avoid colors associated with Islam, such as Green. 

Also consider the fact that we often associate colors to memories we have, think about the color red, when your designing a product that is used for children going to school, its best to avoid it. No kid ever likes to see a teacher with a red pen giving them bad marks.

## What to ask?
To summerize what i talked about, you as a designer can as your self these two simple questions:
1. Whats my target audience, and how has their history influenced their perception of colors?
2. Hows the current state of that country and colors they associate it with?
