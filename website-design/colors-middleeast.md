# The affect of colors  on Middle Easterns

## Red
- Is often associated with Danger, Caution, Evil, but also can be conveyed by good luck

## Blue
- Considered calming and reliefs us from stress. Associated with fertility, strength, heaven. (If hell is warm[red] then the opposite [blue] must be good?)

## Yellow
- Often associated with happiness but in some countries like Egypt its associated with death. However keep the hues in mind as darker hues can cause fear while lighter hues can embrace confidence.

## Green
- Often associated with nature can be relieving for some. Sign of piece and spiritually, belief, surrender. Also its a very easy color on the eyes. However it is related to Islam, and the Military.

*These are colors i really haven't cared too much to do any research about*:
White: Purity, Peace.
Black: Mourning, Strength, Masculinity.
Orange: Strength, endurance.
Brown: Simplicity, Humility.
Purple: Virtue, Omen.
